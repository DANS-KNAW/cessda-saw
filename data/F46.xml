   <dcterms:subject>No sampling. Basic population: persons registered in the Doctoral Council of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and those having a Ph.D. degree. A self-completion questionnaire was posted to their addresses. The return rate of the questionnaires was appr. 33%. The sample is strongly distorted by settlement type, therefore the data had to be weighed. At the second stage a 900-person representative sample was taken from the non-responding persons and they were interviewed. This latter was used as a control sample to examine the differences between the answers of the self-completion questionnaires and the interviews. (This database was not deposited.)</dcterms:subject>
