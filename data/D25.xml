   <dcterms:subject>The survey needed an individual sample which contains only (potential) employees. The sample was drawn from the sample of Reform survey carried out in 1995; those respondents were asked to participate who were willing to participate in later surveys as well. The sample was examined whether those willing to answer significantly differ from those who are not willing; the results of this examination can be found in the documentation. 1300 persons were visited, and the number of successfully completed interviews was 917.</dcterms:subject>
