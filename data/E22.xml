   <dcterms:subject>The sample is a probability sample, prepared by a multi-stage proportionately stratified selection, based on dwelling data. At the first stage a data file was prepared, in which the case number of the settlements is in proportion with the number of the dwellings in that settlement. 15 dwellings were visited in each settlement in the sample. At the next stage the sample was stratified by the regional variable also used by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH), and by the number of dwellings in that settlement. The sampling software selected the settlement in the region with the appropriate number of dwellings using a simple, random sampling procedure. If a settlement was selected to be included in the sample more than once, that many times 15 dwellings were visited by the interviewers. The addresses of the specific households were taken from the date of the Central Registration and Electorial Bureau. The addresses in the sample were identified using a simple random sampling process on the data that was reduced with filtering out adults living at the same address. The sample is a so-called diminishing sample, whih means that the dropping out addresses were calculated with too.</dcterms:subject>
